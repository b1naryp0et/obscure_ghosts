# obscure_ghosts - An Electronic Grading System 👻
#### obscure_ghosts is an alternative grading scheme application for Holberton School Projects. We had 24 hours to build this application as part of the "Checker Challenge" 
 
## The Project

By team of ~8 (our team eventually comprised of 6 engineers), we were free to build what we wanted. It just needed to be related to Holberton School and the Checker. This was quite an interesting endeavor as we were granted access to the Checker API. 


#### Capabilities of our checker:
* Checks if specific Holberton tasks are correct or incorrect
* Full Flasks are displayed for portions of the task which are correct
* Empty Flasks are displayed for portions of the task which are incorrect
* Different messages are displayed depending on outcome

#### High Level Explanation of What We Did

5. Traverse the midst if you dare!!



## UI
Our team determined that using a Dark Souls theme for our project would be suitable. There is an ardent fan-base of Soulsborne players at Holberton. We trade tactics, argue over lore, and collectively ridicule dex build players (The Uchigatana can go to hell!!). Furthermore, there seems to be overlap in the difficulty of the game and the difficult nature of Holberton projects. 
  
## Trials

-   Git merge issues, which you will find in any programming projects
-   Testing: We should have devoted more time and branches to testing. 
-  Team Size: We would have liked to have more engineers on our team.


## Triumphs


-  The engineers we did have for our project were very skilled and pleasant to work with.
-   Our theme displays itself very well.
-  We creatively used concepts from previous projects in the architecture of this project. 
-   We had an excellent team leader in William Dyrland-Marquis
